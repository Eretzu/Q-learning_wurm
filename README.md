This is one of my school project where aim was to teach wurms to move forward with the help of machine learning. 

Interesting files where I did a lot of (all) programming.
world.cpp (and .hpp)
wurm.cpp (and .hpp)
main.cpp (mainly the box2d parts and simulation logic)

Actual build installation information are in src folder README -file.
