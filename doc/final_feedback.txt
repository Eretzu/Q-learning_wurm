Thanks for your active participation.

Design looks very good and documentation is very clear.
Good experimentation with different parameters.
 

 1) There is a easy way to install sfml and cmake similar to Box2D. It need not be pre-installed in Aalto machines
 2) Try to create error during "cmake" if required software is not installed. I believe now the code crashes as compilation is successful. (even when required softwares are not installed)
 3) It is hard to remember magic numbers that are present throughout the code. Using namespace and moving all variables with constant values inside namespace will solve these problems and increases code modularity.
 4) Use unique or smart pointers in code rather than normal pointers.
 5) In some places, documentation differs from implementation. For example, How many swarm-wurms CYAN default - 5
 6) Try to measure performace with different containers (other than vector of vector)
